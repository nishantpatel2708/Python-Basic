Modules:
     Modules are gruoup of functions, variables, and classes that are saved to a file, to reuse them.

          Note:-    Code Reusability
                    Pre-defined modules are: random, keyword, calender, etc..
                         Examples:
                                   import calender
                                   print(calender.month(2022, 1))


Functions:
     functions is gruoup of statements which only excute when we call the fucntion
          Note:-   Code Reusability
                    functions return value as a result
                    we can pass the value to the fucntion called parameters.
          Pre-defined fucntions are: len(), print(), int()
